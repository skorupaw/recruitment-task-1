## Unit Tests

- [ ] Add unit tests. You can find some examples in the [`Mood.spec.tsx`](./frontend/src/components/Mood.spec.tsx) and [`App.spec.tsx`](./frontend/src/App.spec.tsx) files. The setup for the [`msw`](https://mswjs.io/) and [`@testing-library`](https://testing-library.com) can be found in [`/test-utils`](./frontend/src/test-utils/) and [`setup-tests.ts`](./frontend/setup-tests.ts). Once again, if you prefer, you can change the unit test setup, matchers, and runners. This one is configured to run with [`vitest`](https://vitest.dev/)

You can run unit-tests via this command:

```cmd
pnpm run test
```

## Checklist

**1.**

- [ ] Fetch and render a list of "mood cards". To accomplish this, use the [`MoodCard`](./frontend/src/ui/mood-card.tsx) component from the [`/ui`](./frontend/src/ui/) folder and fetch the data from the provided API.

**Request:**

Apollo Client is already set up, so you can jump right into writing a `useQuery` hook.

**Types:**

Types for the GraphQL response can be found in [./frontend/src/api-types/graphql.ts](./frontend/src/api-types/graphql.ts)

**Example response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "moods": {
      "moods": [

**2.**

- [ ] Display 3 loading skeletons while waiting for the response from the server. This can be achieved using the [`MoodCardSkeleton`](./frontend/src/ui/mood-card-skeleton.tsx) component.

---

**3.**

- [ ] Ensure that the search input (which can be found in [`App`](./frontend/src/App.tsx) component) is focused when the page is reloaded.

---

**4.**

- [ ] Add the ability to select and deselect "mood cards" using the `isSelected` and `onSelect` props of the [`MoodCard`](./frontend/src/ui/mood-card.tsx) component.

---

**5.**

- [ ] Limit the number of possible mood selections to 3.

  - [ ] Display error toast message ("You can only select up to 3 moods") when the user tries to click on the 4th card. This can be achieved by calling `toast.error` from [`/ui`](./frontend/src/ui/)

---

**6.**

- [ ] Limit the number of displayed mood cards to 3. You can achieve this by calling the API with appropriate variables:

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Add the query parameter to the URL: `limit=3`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Add the query variable: `{"limit": 3}`.

</details>

---

**7.**

- [ ] Implement the pagination functionality. The [`Navigation`](./frontend/src/ui/Navigation.tsx) component should have two optional props: `onNext` and `onPrevious`. Add appropriate handlers to allow a user to:

  - [ ] By clicking "Next", display the next 3 moods from the API (increase the `limit` by 3 and `skip` by 3)

  - [ ] By clicking "Previous", display the 3 previous moods from the API (decrease `limit` by 3 and `skip` by 3)

  - [ ] Pagination should be reflected in the url

Example:

**For page 1:**
api: limit = 3 and skip = 0

url: /?page=0

**For page 2:**
api: limit = 6 and skip = 3

url: /?page=1

and so on.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The selection state should remain unaffected by the navigation.

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Extend query variables by adding `&skip=3`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Extend query variables by adding `{"skip": 3}`.

</details>

---

**8.**

- [ ] Disable the navigation buttons when waiting for the response from the backend server. It can be achieved by using the `isNextDisabled` and `isPreviousDisabled` props from the [`Navigation`](./frontend/src/ui/navigation.tsx) component.

---

**9.**

- [ ] Add a search option, without impacting the previous functionality. When a user types something into the search input, you should make an API call and display the results accordingly.

  - [ ] Search state should be reflected in the url. `/?search=Happy`

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Pagination should reset when searching.

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Request variables should be set to `?limit=3&search="<search_query>"`

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>GraphQL API:</strong></summary>
<p></p>

Query variables should be set to `{"limit": 3, "search": "<search_query>"}"`

</details>

---

**10.**

- [ ] Debounce the search input. A request shouldn't be sent as long as the user is typing.

---

**11.**

- [ ] Display the [`NoResults`](./frontend/src/ui/no-results.tsx) component from [`ui`](./frontend/src/ui) when no results are found for a given query.

---

**12.**

- [ ] Display additional information about a given mood. This can be achieved by editing the existing [`Mood`](./frontend/src/components/Mood.tsx) component. Use the `moodId` provided from query params to fetch the data, then to display retrieved information use the [`DictionaryCard`](./frontend/src/ui/dictionary-card.tsx) component from [`/ui`](./frontend/src/ui) folder.

> [!TIP]
> Make sure that the user can click on the multiple mood cards while data is loading, but only one state update is performed.

<details>
<summary><strong>REST API:</strong></summary>
